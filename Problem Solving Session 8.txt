#The squared difference has nicer mathematical properties; it's continuously differentiable (nice when you want to minimize it)
One thing that has not been mentioned yet is uniqueness.
The least squares approach always produces a single "best" answer if the matrix of explanatory variables is full rank. 
When minimizing the sum of the absolute value of the residuals it is possible that there may be an infinite number of lines that all 
have the same sum of absolute residuals (the minimum).
